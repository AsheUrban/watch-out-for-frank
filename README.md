## Description

Following along with Frank's Labratory's tutorial, Javascript Side Scroller Game Tutorial, our team delved into learning the basics of coding a sidescroller using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

Our goal was to create a simple and classic style game with a space theme, that included input controls, sprite animation, collision detection, scoring, and a level up challenge or interaction. 

### MVP for our purposes was a game that:
* _sidescrolls_
* _animates characters using spritesheets_
* _detects collisions between the player and enemy sprites_

### Stretch goals include:
* _additional animations for jump and weapons_
* _functional scoring_
* _game over screen/message_
* _level up challenge/object interaction_

## Known Bugs

* _game freezes when player collides with enemy_
